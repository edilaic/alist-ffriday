Family Friday enrollment and selection app in Python using Flask

Setup instructions:
You'll probably want to run this in a virtual environment for your python packages, so to start off you'll want to do something like:
1. virtualenv flask
2. source flask/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python run.py

This will spin up a webserver serving on port 1138, and http://localhost:1138/ should send you on your way!
